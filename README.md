This is an easy tutorial on how to start a business at a young age/near college

You don't even need money to start! Its actually quite simple

1, you need to plan out what your business is going to be about, and what it is going to do. Write that down on a piece of paper of online to remember.

2, you need to make a decision on if your going to be doing this with others, or on your own. For an example, if someone helps you build a websute or give you ideas, then you have a group partnership. If your doing all of this on your own, your in a solo partnership

3, you need to create a website. This can be done using canva, godaddy, wix, and other providers. I personally use canva because it super easy to use.

4, add many pages, including your goal, your about me, why you want to reach this goal, a support page, a contact page, and pages that usually contain that information (links, apps, downloads, text paragraphs) 

5, when adding your contact page, it is suggested to make your own google account. Simply search "create a google account" and click on the link that comes up. Create the new account for business, not child, or myself.

6, if you are making a profit business, you should use wix or godaddy to set up payments on your site or just make a buy me a coffee page to accept payments there if your using sites like canva.

7, after you have published/launched your site, post on social media (nextdoor, instagram, tiktok, youtube, etc.) to gain more fans and views on your site, and more traffic on your product/site itself.

8, make updates to your site daily, and add a report an issue button at the bottom of your page in case anything doesn't work that you didn't catch.


Thats pretty much it! Remember to post your site everywhere on social media, including tiktok, nextdoor, youtube, facebook, etc.
I hope this helped out a lot for you and your business. Now go do great things!
